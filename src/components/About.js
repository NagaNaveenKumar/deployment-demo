<p style={{marginTop:"30px"}}>
Department of CSE has been successfully functioning since 1998, constantly being ranked among the best engineering colleges in Andhra Pradesh for CSE. It offers B.Tech & M.Tech (CSE & SE programmes) Programs. The Department comprises of 6 fully Air conditioned computing centers about 400 systems with sufficient power supply and backup. About twenty three full-time faculty members provide a comprehensive program that emphasizes algorithms and theory, advanced computer architecture, computer vision and pattern recognition, data mining and machine learning, distributed systems, operating systems and computer networks, computer security. </p><p>
The Department is accredited with NBA and is among the NAAC ‘A’ grade engineering colleges in Andhra Pradesh. Department is in MoU with Virtusa Polaris and running the Center of Excellence (COE) in the JAVA platform. Research Center has been sanctioned to the Department from the JNTUK Kakinada. The Department is in MoU with Microsoft and successfully maintaining the Microsoft Innovation Center (MIC). The course structure is up-to-date and includes courses on nascent topics to equip our students with the latest developments in Computer Science and Engineering. Our faculty members aim at delivering top class education blending their rich research experience with classroom teaching. The CSE department strengths include its high faculty-to-student ratio, renowned faculty, strong focus on undergraduate education balanced with leading-edge research, and emphasis on leadership, service, and ethics.  </p><p>
  This department is equipped with the state-of-the-art computer laboratories and laboratories required to cater to the needs of undergraduate and post graduate programmes. In addition, active research is conducted in the realms of modeling, engineering and understanding of software systems related to distributed, cognitive, security, language engineering, databases, wireless networks, web services, cognitive informatics and computer ergonomics domains of computing.
  </p><p>
  Department of Computer Science & Engineering strives to provide scope for all round development of the students and staff by engaging them in various activities such as:<br/>
M-1. Providing the best educational facilities for training students for the careers in science and technology.<br/>
M-2. Providing a creative atmosphere in which higher studies and research thrive both among the students and the faculty.<br/>
M-3. Undertaking collaborative projects which offer opportunities for long-term interaction with academia and industry.<br/>
M-4. Sensitization towards importance for ethical practice, societal responsibility, leadership, entrepreneurship, communication and lifelong learning. </p><p>
  This department is actively involved in modernizing and developing the laboratories with World Bank project, Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme. All laboratories, which are useful for undergraduate programme are strengthened by procuring necessary equipment to conduct various experiments and projects. In addition, new laboratories in the area of Software Testing, Internet Technologies, Programming Languages and Data Engineering are developed to cater to the needs of existing programmes. However, these facilities are to be augmented further with new equipment to improve the facilities and to offer new post graduate programmes. In addition, new faculty members (having expertise to teach advanced subjects) are to be recruited. Building space is to planned and obtained for the new courses. Library books have to be procured as per the new PG programmes to be offered. Presently, the faculty of this department has expertise in various advanced fields in the state-of-the-art technologies like Data Mining, Image Processing, Information Security, Computer Networks, Cloud Computing, Social Network Analysis and Internet Of Things. The department aims at promoting industry oriented research.
